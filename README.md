# My dotfile archive

This is my dotfile archive with installation and configuration scripts
**heavily** inspired from [OMAKUB by DHH](https://omakub.org/). The basic idea
is to have a replicable setup working with SUSE Linux distribution.

## Installation

```
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thesp0nge/dotfiles/master/sp0ngify.sh -O -)"
```
